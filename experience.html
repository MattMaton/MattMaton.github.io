                        <p>After finishing school in 2018 I wanted to gain some work experience before deciding what career I wanted to do. PG Online is an independent educational publisher, I started out as a data and sales administrator. After a year I was promoted to Commercial Developer which expanded my role taking on more responsibility. This included managing PG Online’s database which I used to provide analytics and access areas of the data that were out of reach otherwise. I also gathered more responsibility in regards to the company’s sales and having an input in future products. I took the information I learnt from my role in sales and data processing and applied this into refining the sales process and company website. At my time at PG Online I also took on the task of developing their social media presence and within a year I had doubled the number of followers on the PG Online Twitter account.</p>

                        <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic I had time to reflect on my current situation and realised that I wished to follow my passion and hopefully turn my hobby into a career. This led to me studying Computing and Software Development at the University of Plymouth.</p>

                        <p>As a part of my role at PG Online I developed reports and dashboard in the software Microsoft Power BI. After I left PG Online to study at University, I took this knowledge and decided to start working with businesses to develop Power BI dashboards to suit their needs. At first it a hobby but now I am regularly having meetings with clients who are both UK based and international. These clients range from small family businesses to multimillion-pound companies, all of whom I work directly with to develop effective insightful reports. </p>
